/** Quote from Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77:
 * It is not uncommon, in real life, to be dealing with a distribution whose second
 * moment does not exist (i.e., is infinite). In this case, the variance or standard
 * deviation is useless as a measure of the dataâ€™s width around its central value:
 * The values obtained from equations (14.1.2) or (14.1.3) will not converge with
 * increased numbers of points, nor show any consistency from data set to data set
 * drawn from the same distribution. This can occur even when the width of the peak
 * looks, by eye, perfectly finite.
 * 
 * <p>inspired by
 * <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Variance.html">Variance</a>
